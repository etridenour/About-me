        <h1>Well hello there</h1>

        <p>What's up?. My name is Eric Ridenour. I am completely new to coding and am very excited to get started. I graduated from the University of Colorado with a degree in audio engineering. I used to teach high school and am now a freelance drummer and percussion arranger for various high school marching bands. I currently teach the drumline at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9XMNZmvR9Y">Cavaliers</a>, a drum corps based out of Chicago. I recently just joined a band called <a href="https://soundcloud.com/search?q=steal%20carmona">Steal Carmona</a>. You can check out a video of our most recent performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=466&v=ba3t05-PSc4">here</a>.</p>
        <p>I love the outdoors. I lived in Colorado for 13 years and developed a passion for mountain biking and snowboarding. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C0bjpuh48I">Here</a> is an old, low quality video of me completely eating it. Every summer I go on a multi-day hike on the Art Loeb trail located in the beautiful Pisgah National Forest right outside Asheville, NC.</p>
